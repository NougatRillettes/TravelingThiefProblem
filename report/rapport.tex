\begin{abstract}
	We hereby present our solution to the traveling thief problem. Using a two phase algorithm inspired by \cite{Polyakovskiy}, we manage to reach solutions of about $16k$ on the easiest instance.
\end{abstract}

\section{Our algorithm}
Following the idea of Polyakovsiy \textit{et al.} \cite{Polyakovskiy} our algorithm runs in two phases. First a run for the traveling salesman problem is generated. Second, using this run, the algorithm plans which objects are to be picked up so as to maximize the total profit of our thief.

It is noteworthy that, whereas our algorithm for the first phase is kind of intricate, the one used for the second phase is merely a classical simulated annealing.

\subsection{The TSP algorithm}
To solve the TSP problem, we first build a greedy solution on which we run an exhaustive 2-opt, and which we then improve with different heuristics: basic node permutation, \textit{2-opt} and an permutation we call \textit{stitching} which is actually a specialization of \textit{3-opt}. A possible output is given figure \ref{tsp_sol}.

\begin{figure}[hp]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{tsp}
	\label{tsp_sol}
	\caption{A possible tour, as found by our algorithm.}
\end{figure}


Both node inversion and stitching are accepting with a probability depending on a temperature $T$ that is exponentially decreasing.\\

We introduce the following notation, for any $x \in \mathcal{R}_+$ we define $\overline{x} = \max(1,x)$.

\subsubsection{Node inversion}:
This operation simply picks two nodes uniformly at random, compute $\Delta$ the difference of length of the tour if this two nodes are permuted and actually does this permutation with probability $\overline{e^{\frac{-\Delta}{T}}}$.

\subsubsection{Stitching}:
\begin{figure}[htbp]
	\centering
	
	\begin{subfigure}{0.4\textwidth}
		
		\centering
		\includegraphics[angle=90,width=\linewidth,height=0.15\textheight]{stitch1}
		\caption{Before stitching}
		\label{stitch1}
		
	\end{subfigure}
	\vspace{2em}
	\begin{subfigure}{0.4\textwidth}
		
		\centering
		\includegraphics[angle=90,width=\linewidth,height=0.15\textheight]{stitch2}
		\caption{After stitching}
		\label{stitch2}
		
	\end{subfigure}
	\captionsetup{format=plain}
	\caption{Illustration of the stitching operation}
	\label{stitch_fig}
\end{figure}

As illustrated in figure \ref{stitch_fig}, the stitching operation consist in "inserting a part of the tour between two nodes". As with the nodes inversion, this is only done with probability $\overline{e^{\frac{-\Delta}{T}}}$ where $\Delta$ is the cost difference.

It can be remarked that stitching is a restriction of 3-opt that does not allow one to change the orientation of one of the three sub parts.

\subsubsection{2-opt}
Two opt is plentifully described in literature. We simply implement it in two flavors. In the exhaustive one, all possibilities are tested. In the random flavor, only a random pair of points is evaluated, and accepted with probability $\overline{e^{\frac{-\Delta}{T}}}$ where $\Delta$ is the cost difference.

\subsection{Knapsack}
Once the tour is generated, we still have to choose wich items to pick up. To this end, we simply use the RLS algorithm described in \cite{Polyakovskiy}.

\subsection{Number of iterations}
Because we need to run two optimizing heuristics one after the other, we must give a way to the algorithm to decide whether or not it has reached a good solution for the TSP. Because the keystone of our algorithm is the random selection of two (for 2-opt and node inversion) or three (for stitching) nodes, and because the expected run time of a coupon collector on $n^2$ entries is about $2n^2\ln(n)$, we would like to say that our algorithm is done once there have been $4n^2\ln(n)$ iteration without improving the score, which gives a probability $1/n^2$ of having missed some couple of points.

Unfortunately, this is often far too big, and we hence set a timed artificial limit of ten minutes.

As is often the case when doing simulated annealing, we do several (here 10) run of the "optimization with decreasing temperature" part. This gives the overall algorithm in figure \ref{algo}.

\begin{figure}
\begin{algorithmic}
	\State Generate greedy TSP
	\State do one exhaustive 2-opt
\For {$i \in 0..10$}
	\State temp = 1
	\While{One of the last $4n^2\ln(n)$ iterations has improved the score \&\& Elapsed time for this loop is < 3:00}
	\State do 4 RLS for inversion
	\State do 1 RLS for 2-opt
	\State do 1 RLS for stitching
	\State temp $/=$ 0.9999
	\EndWhile
	\EndFor
\For {$i \in 0..10$}
\State temp = 100	
	\While{One of the last $2n\ln(n)$ iterations has improved the score \&\& Elapsed time for this loop is < 3:00}
	\State do 1 RLS
	\State temp $/=$ 0.9999
	\EndWhile
	\EndFor

\end{algorithmic}

\section{Possible improvements}
There is two possible improvements I would have like to have time to work on.
\subsection{Correlation of temperature parameter with entry}
No parameter for the temperatures (initial value and decrease rate) gave satisfying results on all instances. A possible improvement would be to find a relation between the entry dimensions and the ideal values of those parameter.
\subsection{Different weighting for the TSP}
In our TSP solving, all edges have a cost assigned by their euclidean distance. Yet, at the end of the tour, the thief will be more heavily loaded, hence assigning a greater cost per length unit to the edges at the end of the tour might be a good idea. This would lead to tour biased towards short edges at the end. Yet, one has to be careful when adding more parameter to the algorithm, and finding a good way to increase the edge cost per length unit might very well turn out to be quite tricky.
